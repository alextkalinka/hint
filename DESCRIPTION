Description: Hypergeometric Intersection distributions are a
    broad group of distributions that describe the probability of picking
    intersections when drawing independently from two (or more) urns
    containing variable numbers of balls belonging to the same n
    categories. Kalinka (2013) <arXiv:1305.0717>.
